# Activity Register:
## Where you can keep track of your daily tasks and appointments!
This is a simple code that implements an Activity Register where you can note down all your tasks and reminders for each day, just like a regular Calendar would do!
### Usage:
You simply open it up, select a date and save the activity you need to keep track of, specifying the timespan this activity will take you and its Description!
You can then select a date to view the list of all activities saved by far on that day and decide to delete them once they're completed (or maybe keep them to always have a personal log to remind yourself what you've been doing in the recent days!)<br>
### Features:
#### VIEW:
The view section it's pretty simple, it's just like a regular calendar. You can go through months by clicking left or right arrows on top or directly select it from the drop-down menu, as well as for the yers.
#### ADD:
To add an activity simply head all the way down of the window and click on the 'New Activity' button. From here just select the Date, the Starting and Ending times of the activity and add a Description to it to better remember what is your task!<br>
WARNING: Be careful when specifying the attributes of the activity. Selecting an invalid date will result in an error message as well as selecting and Ending Time that it's equal or even previous to the Starting Time. Description is MANDATORY!<br>
NOTE: if you are trying to add an activity during a timespan where you already have activities active the system will warn you that you are already busy during this time period (just to not book too many things in the same day!), you can, however, decide to add it anyways, it's up to you!
When you're done press 'OK', or 'CANCEL' if you don't want to add the activity anymore.
#### DELETE:
To delete an already added activity just click on the day that activity has been saved and look for it in the scroll list. Once you've find it simply press 'Delete'. Once an activity is deleted you can't reverse it, you can, though, just simply re-add it!
